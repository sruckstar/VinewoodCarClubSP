Now you can visit the Vinewood Car Club in story mode of GTA 5 on PC. The garage offers 10 vehicles that you can acquire free of charge.

This is a beta version in which I have attempted to accurately replicate all the vehicles from GTA Online. Some liveries from the next-generation consoles are not available on PC, so alternative liveries are used in the mod.

In future versions of the mod, you will be able to customize the vehicles in the garage yourself, adding any models you desire through the in-game menu.
