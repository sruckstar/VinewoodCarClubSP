Now you can visit the Vinewood Car Club in story mode of GTA 5 on PC. The garage offers 10 vehicles that you can acquire free of charge. Some liveries from the next-generation consoles are not available on PC, so alternative liveries are used in the mod.

The mod syncs with the GitHub page to automatically update vehicles in the garage, just like in GTA Online. You can disable this feature by setting CHECK UPDATES to 0 in the VineWoodClubCars.ini file.

Requirements: ScriptHookDotNet, LemonUI
