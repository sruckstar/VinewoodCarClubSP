Now you can visit the Vinewood Car Club in story mode of GTA 5 on PC. The garage offers 10 vehicles that you can acquire free of charge. Some liveries from the next-generation consoles are not available on PC, so alternative liveries are used in the mod.

If you want the cars in the car club to synchronize with GTA Online, download the actual VineWoodClubCars.ini file


I HAVE AN INFINITE LOADING SCREEN WHEN I ENTER THE GARAGE. WHAT TO DO

The infinite loading is due to the game not being able to find the car model. Check if you are playing on a current version of GTA 5 and if there are no typos in VineWoodClubCars.ini

Requirements: ScriptHookDotNet, LemonUI
